'''
You track your daily engagement rates as a list of integers, sorted in non-decreasing order. To analyze the impact of certain strategies, you decide to square each engagement rate and then sort the results in non-decreasing order.

Given an integer array engagements sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Your Task:

Read through the existing solution and add comments so that everyone in your pod understands how it works.
Modify the solution below to use the two-pointer technique.
def engagement_boost(engagements):
    squared_engagements = []
    
    for i in range(len(engagements)):
        squared_engagement = engagements[i] * engagements[i]
        squared_engagements.append((squared_engagement, i))
    
    squared_engagements.sort(reverse=True)
    
    result = [0] * len(engagements)
    position = len(engagements) - 1
    
    for square, original_index in squared_engagements:
        result[position] = square
        position -= 1
    
    return result
